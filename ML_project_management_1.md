### Machine Learning Opportunity Framework

1. **Problem Identification**
   - **Is There a Problem?**
     - Identify users and their pain points.
     - Assess current solutions and identify gaps.
     
2. **Feasibility Assessment**
   - **Can Machine Learning Solve It?**
     - Evaluate the ease or difficulty of applying machine learning to the identified problem.
     - Determine if the problem falls into the categories where machine learning can be effective.
     
3. **Value Proposition**
   - **Does Anyone Care About the Solution?**
     - Determine if the solution adds business value for users.
     - Understand the user's interest and willingness to adopt the solution.

4. **Validation Process**
   - **Run Small Experiments** 
     - Test potential solution concepts with users.
     - Gather and analyze feedback.
     - Adjust and refine based on feedback.
     - Repeat the process to converge to an optimal solution.
     
5. **Development Considerations**
   - **Heuristics vs. Machine Learning**
     - Start with heuristics to set a baseline performance.
     - Evaluate the necessity and benefits of machine learning.
     - If proceeding with machine learning, begin with simple algorithms before moving to more complex ones.
     - Continuously evaluate machine learning performance against heuristic baseline.

This framework guides through identifying machine learning opportunities, assessing their feasibility, validating the solutions, and making development decisions based on initial findings.
